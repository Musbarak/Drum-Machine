Learning outcome:Build a Drum Machine.
My Deliverables:I should make use of 4 colors from one of the color pallete provided.
The functionalities:
1,I used document.getElementById and document.querySelectorAll to select elements fom the HTML so i can use them in javascript.
2,I used playsound function to check if the sound is on/off and also finds the sound to play based on which pad is pressed. When playing the sound,it updates the display and added a css effect to show it's active.
3, For each pad, it goes throug every pad using for each. And i addd eventlistner, that is ,when the pad is clicked with my mouse it i calls playsond.
4, Window.eventlistner. it listens to any key pressed on the keyboard. It also checks if the presssed key matches any datakey i used in my html. and them finally if the key matches, it plays the sound just as i click the pad.
